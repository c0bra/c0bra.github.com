Internet was new back then and our main role as a digital agency was to introduce this new concept to the companies around us.
As any small startup, my role was divided into several fields, like management, development and design. Later on focusing on design.
Even though I am not directly connected to the company, I still provide design services &amp; consultancy when needed.
